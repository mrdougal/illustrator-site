# My name is Dougal MacPherson, and I illustrate childrens books.

Like most people i drew throughout my childhood and teenage years, as I grew older and entered the workforce I drew less. That is until one rainy sunday afternoon I drew a digger to entertain my young son.
My son was amazed that I could magically make the digger appear on the page, and so i was requested to draw a truck, and then another digger.

Since then I've illustrated for tech [websites](http://alistapart.com) and [conferences](http://www.rubyconf.org.au/2015) and now, a [childrens book](/books/introducing-teddy). 

I live in the southern hemisphere with my wife, son, daughter and a cat called monster.
