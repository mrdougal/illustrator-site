# Hello, I illustrate childrens books

It all started one rainy Sunday afternoon when I drew a digger and a truck to entertain my young son. 
Making the digger appear on the page was pure magic to my son, so I started drawing again.

Since then I've illustrated for tech [websites](http://alistapart.com) and [conferences](http://www.rubyconf.org.au/2015) and now, a [childrens book](/books/introducing-teddy). 
I live in Melbourne Australia with my wife, son, daughter and a cat called monster.
